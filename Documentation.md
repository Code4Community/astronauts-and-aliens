### Ideas For Direction of the Game:
- Two "entities," astronaut spacship and alien UFO
- Randomly generated obstacles between them to begin game (asteroids)
     - can also have explosive obstacle and health pack obstacle
- Players can take turns to move ship around, and fire (using an angle)
     - Thought: turn should be limited to line limit
          - This means would need to prohibit loops
- Idea: set "angle" variable outside of script (separate text box)

## Other Possible Ideas:
- Local versus
- smarter ai enemy
- have large obstacles with "gravity" (suns, planets)
- have different kinds of projectiles

## Tasks
- Sprites
   - spaceship, ufo, asteroids
- Obstacles
- Functions for player/opponent
- Turns

### Ideas for Implementing turn based play

-- Add event listeners to interact with Html 

--Kid will do turn 
--triggers even lister
--trigers change to boolean as to whose turn it is
     --- seperate function (ie boolean outside of updateS)
